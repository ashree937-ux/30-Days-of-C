# 30-Days of C

## DAY 1-3: 🧮 Calculator in C (Menu-Driven)

A console-based calculator application written in C, built to strengthen core programming fundamentals such as functions, loops, conditionals, and modular code structure.

This project intentionally prioritizes clarity and correctness over complexity, making it ideal for academic use and foundational learning.


### 🚀 Features

**🔹 Basic Arithmetic Operations**

• Addition

• Subtraction

• Multiplication

• Division

*Highlights:*

• Supports multiple operands per calculation

• Uses '=' to terminate input (calculator-style input flow)

• Converts string input to floating-point values using strtof()

• Includes basic division-by-zero checks

**🔹 Power & Modulus Operations**

• Power calculation using pow() 

• Modulus calculation using fmod()

• Prevents invalid operations such as modulus by zero

**🔹 Menu-Driven Interface**

• Simple and clear menu navigation

• Separate functions for each operation group

• Allows repeated operations without restarting the program

**🔹 Calculation History**

• Stores results in a fixed-size array

• View previously calculated results

• Clear history when needed

• Designed using simple global state to keep the implementation clear and beginner-friendly

### 🧠 Design Philosophy

This project was built with learning-first decisions, not feature overload.

✔ Modular function design

✔ Clear control flow

✔ Focus on logic and fundamentals

✔ Readable and maintainable structure

*Intentionally Avoided*

• Expression evaluation with BODMAS (requires stacks)

• Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, calloc)

• Macros (#define)

• GUI components

• Over-engineered abstractions

These choices keep the project aligned with the current academic learning stage.

### 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

stdio.h    // Input and output

string.h  // String handling

stdlib.h  // strtof()

math.h    // pow(), fmod()

### ▶️ How to Compile & Run(in Bash)

To compile : 
gcc calculator.c -o calculator -lm

To run : 
./calculator

### 📂 Project Structure

calculator.c   // Main source file

README.md      // Project documentation

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

• No operator precedence (BODMAS not implemented)

• One operation type per calculation

• Console-based only

• Fixed-size history (no persistence across runs)

• Input validation is basic (learning-focused)

These limitations are intentional and appropriate for the scope of this project.

### 📈 Possible Future Enhancements
(Not part of the current scope)

• Expression evaluation using stacks

• Improved input validation

• Persistent history storage

• GUI-based version in another language

### ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates:

• Strong understanding of C fundamentals

• Effective use of functions and loops

• Thoughtful scope control

• Clean, readable, and maintainable code

It serves as a solid academic project and a reliable foundation for more advanced programming concepts in the future.
